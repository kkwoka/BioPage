            <h3><u>Info About Me:</u></h3>
            I am 26 years old. I live in North Austin, basically Cedar Park. I have an amazing doggo named Koda.
            He is a 4.5 year old, 80 pound Blue Lacy / Am. Staff. mix. He can run up to 20 miles in a single day 
            and has been clocked at 29.8 mph. He's a very fast doggo. (Did I mention that he is amazing?)
            I love to ride my mountain bike. I have traveled the country with my partner and dog several times in our van. 
            Yes, it gets very cramped! I love coffee, but only with half n half. I hate flavored creamers, BLECH! I cut my own hair.
            But, if I have to spend money, I'll go to a babershop instead of a hair salon. I am conversationally fluent in sign language
            and am working on getting better. I can sign decently well, but my comprehension is sometimes slow. 
            I am sarcastic and silly, don't let my RBF deter you!
